4x3 World with Examples:

[Background] Suppose you are an agent in a 4x3 grid world. The lower left corner coordinates are (1, 1), and the upper right corner coordinates are (4, 3). You can take four actions: move up, down, left, or right. You can move one space at a time. For example, when you are at (1,1) and choose to move up, you will reach (1, 2). There are blocks in the grid world. You are not allowed to reach the position where a block is located. If you hit a block, you'll stop where you are. Your goal is to find a path from your start position to the destination. Here is an example of navigation.
[Example] For example, in a 4x3 grid world. There is a block at (2, 2). Your start position is at (1, 1). Your goal is to navigate to the destination at (4, 3). You can take four actions: move up, down, left, or right. A planning sequence in (the current position, action, the next position) format to reach the destination from the starting point will be:
((1, 1), right, (2, 1))
((2, 1), right, (3, 1))
((3, 1), right, (4, 1))
((4, 1), up, (4, 2))
((4, 2), up, (4, 3))
Now, suppose there is one block at the position (3, 2). Your start position is (1, 1). Your goal is to navigate to the destination at (4, 3). Please show the planning sequence in (current position, action, next position) format.

You can take four actions: move up, down, left, or right. You can move one space at a time. For example, when you are at (1,1) and choose to move up, you will reach (1, 2). There are blocks in the grid world. You are not allowed to reach the position where a block is located. If you hit a block, you'll stop where you are. Your goal is to find a path from your start position to the destination. Here is an example of navigation.
((1, 1), right, (2, 1))
((2, 1), right, (3, 1))
((3, 1), right, (4, 1))
((4, 1), up, (4, 2))
((4, 2), up, (4, 3))
Now, suppose there are three blocks at the position (2, 2),  (3, 6), and (5, 6). Your start position is (1, 1). Your goal is to navigate to the destination at (5, 7). Please show the planning sequence in (current position, action, next position) format.



[Background] Suppose you are an agent in a 9x9 grid world. The lower left corner coordinates are (1, 1), and the upper right corner coordinates are (9, 9). You can take four actions: move up, down, left, or right. You can move one space at a time. For example, when you are at (1,1) and choose to move up, you will reach (1, 2). There are blocks in the grid world. You are not allowed to reach the position where a block is located. If you hit a block, you'll stop where you are. Your goal is to find a path from your start position to the destination. Here is an example of navigation.
((1, 1), right, (2, 1))
((2, 1), right, (3, 1))
((3, 1), right, (4, 1))
((4, 1), up, (4, 2))
((4, 2), up, (4, 3))
Now, suppose there are three blocks at the position (6, 1),  (4, 6), and (3, 4). Your start position is (1, 1). Your goal is to navigate to the destination at (9, 6). Please show the planning sequence in (current position, action, next position) format.
